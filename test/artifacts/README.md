# Golden Baseline Artifacts

This directory stores test seeds and golden reference outputs used for deterministic regression checks.

## Prototype reference baselines

The `prototype-reference/` folders under each artifact case are committed golden outputs.

Freeze metadata:
- baseline date: `2026-02-14`
- upstream freeze: `linguistic-enricher@1.1.34`
- reference: `https://www.npmjs.com/package/linguistic-enricher/v/1.1.34`

These baselines are intended for stable comparison and review of output deltas over time.
