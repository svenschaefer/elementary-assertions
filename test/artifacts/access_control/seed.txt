An access control system regulates who may perform specific actions on protected resources.
Users authenticate using credentials and are assigned one or more roles.
Each role grants permissions such as read, write, or administer.
Before an action is executed, the system must verify that the user holds the required permission.
All access decisions should be recorded for auditing and security analysis.
