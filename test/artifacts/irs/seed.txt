The Incident Reporting System (IRS) is used by employees to submit reports about safety issues,
policy violations, or operational incidents.

Reports may include structured fields (category, severity, location) as well as free-form descriptions.
Employees can attach photos, documents, or reference related incidents.

Before a report is accepted, the system must verify that:
 - the reporter is authenticated,
 - the selected category is valid,
 - mandatory fields are present.

Once submitted, reports are reviewed by supervisors.
Supervisors may:
 - request clarification,
 - change the severity level,
 - assign corrective actions.

All actions must be logged for audit purposes.
The system must retain reports for at least 10 years, even if an employee leaves the company.
